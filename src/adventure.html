      <p>Known as the First Lands, Ionia is an island continent of natural beauty and magic. 
        Its inhabitants, living in loosely collected provinces, are a spiritual people, 
        seeking harmony with the world. They remained largely neutral until their land 
        was invaded by Noxus—this brutal occupation forced Ionia to reassess its place in the world, 
        and its future path remains undetermined.</p>

      <p>Shurima was once a thriving civilization that spanned the southern continent, 
        left in ruins by the fall of its god-emperor. 
        Over millennia, tales of its former glory became myth and ritual. 
        Now, its nomadic inhabitants eke out a life in the deserts, or turn to mercenary work. 
        Still, some dare to dream of a return to the old ways.</p>

      <p>The Shadow Isles were once a beautiful realm, long since shattered by a magical cataclysm. 
        Now, Black Mist permanently shrouds the land, tainting and corrupting with its malevolent 
        sorcery. Those who perish within it are condemned to become part of it for all eternity… 
        and worse still, each year the Mist extends its grasp to reap more souls across Runeterra.</p>
      <br />
